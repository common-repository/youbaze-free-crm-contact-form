Insert and customize contact forms and manage enquiries on your WordPress website and import them directly into your YouBaze account (YouBaze is free cloud software for small businesses).

== Description ==

With the YouBaze Contact Form plugin you can insert and customize contact form widgets to your WordPress website allowing you to manage enquiries ranging from customer questions, applications, press requests, RMA forms and more. You can configure input-labels, form title, error messages, confirmation email text, etc.; per widget, and all in your own language. Furthermore you can indicate whether specific fields should be visible or not, and whether they are required or optional fields.

On succesfull validation of a form submitted by one of your website's visitors, the plugin will send your custom confirmation email to the user and will send an email containing all information to you (the website owner). You can use this plugin 'standalone', but to take full advantage of this plugin, you will need to open a (free) YouBaze account. The plugin will automatically attach a special file to the email sent to you (the website owner) allowing you to directly import a new contact into your YouBaze account, linking the incoming email to this new contact, and assigning a correspondence number to the email.
